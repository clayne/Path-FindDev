Path::FindDev

This package is mostly a glue layer around "Path::IsDev" with a few
directory walking tricks.

    use Path::FindDev qw( find_dev );

    if ( my $root = find_dev('/some/path/to/something/somewhere')) {
        print "development root = $root";
    } else {
        print "No development root :(";
    }
